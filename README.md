# Reactive Quarkus Workshop - Reactive Messaging - Lab

This repository includes the lab assignment on _Reactive Messaging_.

## Getting started

In this exercise, you'll be working on a couple of unit tests that exercise the correct behavior of a small event-based system. You won't need any external dependencies.

The assignment is described in `ASSIGNMENT.md`. If you're stuck, there are hints available in `HINTS.md`.
